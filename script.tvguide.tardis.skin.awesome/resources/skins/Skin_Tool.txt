You can use the ActivateWindow() [[List of Built In Functions|Built In Function]] to open a certain [[Window IDs|Window]]. 
This command can be assigned to a [[Button control|button]] in a skin or mapped to a key in your [[Keyboard.xml|Keymap]].
'''Example:'''
* This will take you directly to the settings section of xbmc:
<pre>ActivateWindow(Settings)</pre>
Some windows even allow you to jump directly to a sub-section of that window. 
'''Example:'''
* If you want a button in your skin or on your remote to take you directly to the movie listing, you let that button do:
<pre>ActivateWindow(Videos,MovieTitles)</pre>
