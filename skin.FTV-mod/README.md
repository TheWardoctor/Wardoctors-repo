#fTV skin modification with full working and integrated LiveTV part
A lot of you were begging Hitcher to implement LiveTV to his awesome fTV skin. So... I had a few hours left to take care of it ;)

Original fTV skin by Hitcher: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=207475

#Important:
- Not compatible to Hitcher's official repo version, sorry
- The skin has its own skin ID. So you can keep both, Hitchers fTV and my mod. Just take care of different skin folder names.
- I did not take care of PVR based radio. Hello? We are in 2015. Use the internet radio addons ;)
